testing customized webpage


Add contents:

- Follow the "tab" organization.
- Documents in documents folder,  tutorials in tutorial folder
- if your page is "complex" (contains more than one page/markdown file, contains pictures), then create a subfolder
- to add an image, create again another subfolder and put there your image, while the .md files lies outside
- see example c_example_with_auto

I finally figured out the trick, if you're looking for a solution with the standard URL for GitHub Pages (username.github.io/project-name/). Here's what to do:

In _config.yml, set the baseurl option to /project-name -- note the leading slash and the absence of a trailing slash.

Now you'll need to change the way you do links in your templates and posts, in the following two ways:

When referencing JS or CSS files, do it like this: {{ site.baseurl }}/path/to/css.css -- note the slash immediately following the variable (just before "path").

When doing permalinks or internal links, do it like this: {{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }} -- note that there is no slash between the two variables.

Finally, if you'd like to preview your site before committing/deploying using jekyll serve, be sure to pass an empty string to the --baseurl option, so that you can view everything at localhost:4000 normally (without /project-name getting in there to muck everything up): jekyll serve --baseurl ''

This way you can preview your site locally from the site root on localhost, but when GitHub generates your pages from the gh-pages branch all the URLs will start with /project-name and resolve properly.
