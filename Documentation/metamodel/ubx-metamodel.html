Algorithms, computations, processes, workflows,&hellip; are some of the more common
terms for the concept of 
<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">functions</a>
that transform 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">data structures</a>,
coordinated by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_flow">control flows</a>.
This document introduces a formal specification for them,
called the 
&ldquo;<strong>microblocks <a href="#metamodel">meta model</a>&rdquo;</strong>.
(This document follows the 
<a href="http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~bruyninc/paradigm-MDE.html">paradigm
of Model Driven Engineering</a> (&ldquo;MDE&rdquo;), that
provides three levels of &ldquo;models&rdquo; (<em>meta meta model</em>,
m<em>eta model</em>, and m<em>odel</em>) and one level of &ldquo;<em>system
realisation</em>&rdquo;, or &ldquo;implementation&rdquo;.)
The objective of the modelling effort is (i) to help developers
<strong>to model algorithms</strong> and their <strong>compositions</strong>,
and (ii) <strong>to create tools</strong> that can
<strong>reason</strong> about such models, for example to connect them
to executable <strong>code</strong>, even under stringent 
<strong>realtime and resource constraints</strong>.

<p>
The <strong>primitives</strong> in (the <em>structural</em> part of) the
<em>microblock</em> meta model are all shown in the Figure above. The
aggregation of all these types of meta model primitives is called a
&ldquo;<strong>cblock</strong>, or &ldquo;computational microblock&rdquo;.
In (the structural part of) the meta model, these primitives are
complemented by <strong>relationships</strong> that each connect two (or
more) of the four types of &ldquo;<strong>ports</strong>&rdquo; in the meta
model. Indeed, a microblock can have:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
zero or more <strong>(data) ports</strong>, that give
it <strong> access to data</strong> that it processes in its computations.
</p>
<p>
The data structures in ports have semantic
<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model">data
models</a></strong>, for example formally represented in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdf5">Hierarchical Data Format</a>
(&ldquo;HDF5&rdquo;) or in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcdf">NetCDF</a>.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
zero or more <strong>trigger (ports)</strong>: (i) <em>input</em>
triggers that make the cblock <strong>execute functions</strong> that it
encapsulates, and (ii) <em>output</em> triggers that allow it to 
<strong>trigger the execution</strong> of other microblocks.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
zero or more <strong>configuration value (ports)</strong>, with
which its <strong>behaviour can be adapted</strong> externally. For example, the
&ldquo;gain&rdquo; of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a>
cblock, or the size of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">circular buffer</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
three semantic
<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_identifier">identifier (ports)</a></strong>
(&ldquo;sUID&rdquo;), which are strings that serve as pointers to the
formal model of the <strong>semantics</strong> of the microblock:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>meta model UID</strong>: the identifier of the meta model, or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain-Specific
Language</a> (&ldquo;DSL&rdquo;),
that has been used to model the microblock.
</li>
<li>
<strong>model UID</strong>: the identifier of the concrete model that
describes the semantic meaning of the microblock, and that uses the
above-mentioned meta model as its language.
</li>
<li>
<strong>realisation UID</strong>: the identifier of this particular
realisation of the above-mentioned model. The same model can, indeed, be
realised multiple times, and it is necessary to be able to
differentiate between these instances.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>
The lines that connect ports of microblocks (see Figures below) represent
a structural interaction <strong>relationship</strong> between the
ports, and they <em>do not</em> imply any form of
&ldquo;sending of data or events&rdquo; through the lines. Indeed, using
communication for the interaction is <em>only one of the many ways</em>
that the interaction between the blocks can be implemented in
<em>realisations</em> of the model.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the above-mentioned structural primitives and relationships
of microblocks, the microblocks meta model has three 
&ldquo;<strong>behavioural primitives</strong>&rdquo;, composed in
different ways from the above-mentioned structural primitives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>cblock</strong>, that represents
<strong>computational behaviour</strong>, i.e., functions, and that has all
above-mentioned structural primitives.
</br>
Examples of cblocks are:
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low-pass filter</a>,
or a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVD_%28mathematics%29">Singular Value
Decomposition</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>iblock</strong>, or &ldquo;<em>i<strong>nteraction block</strong></em>&rdquo;,
that represents 
<strong>constraints between the data involved in cblock interactions</strong>.
Access to that data takes place through each structural data
primitive, a &ldquo;port&rdquo;, by means of <strong>read()</strong> and
<strong>write()</strong> functions to that part of the iblock that is
accessible via that particular port. In addition to data ports, an iblock
also has configuration values and semantic identifiers.
</br>
Examples of iblocks are: a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_%28computer_science%29">memory buffer</a>
or a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_map">road map</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>sblock</strong>, or &ldquo;<em><strong>scheduling block</strong></em>&rdquo;,
that represents 
<strong>constraints on the sequencing of cblock computations</strong>.
Activation of (internal and/or external) computations is available via (one
or more) trigger ports, by means of <strong>trigger()</strong> functions.
In addition to trigger ports, an sblock also has configuration values and
semantic identifiers.
</br>
Examples of sblocks are: a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for loop</a>
and other
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iteration">iterators</a>; or
rule-based function call scheduling.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A cblock executes functions, but has
<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29">no
side effects</a></strong>, <em>except</em> (possibly) changing the state of an
iblock. Each cblock, iblock or sblock can be a <strong>composition</strong>
in itself (see Figure below), of cblocks, iblocks
and/or sblocks. Some microblocks <em>must</em> have side effects because they
serve as &ldquo;<a href="#bridges">bridges</a>&rdquo; to other semantic or
execution domains. The composition allows, among other things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a <strong>cblock</strong> to contain also data (e.g., the computational
state of an algorithm) and to trigger the execution of sub-functions.
</li>
<li>
an <strong>iblock</strong> to provide also computations, such
as the data management of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO">FIFO</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">circular</a>, or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update">read-copy-update</a>
buffers, or that of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">software
transactional memory</a>.
</li>
<li>
an <strong>sblock</strong> to provide also computations, such
as the computation of a schedule on the basis of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference">rules</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since each cblock can have multiple triggers and schedules, and since each
iblock can have reads and writes through its various ports, and since each
sblock can have multiple triggers, a (composite) microblock can have
<strong>multiple entry and multiple exit points</strong>. For the same
reasons, the <strong>execution schedule</strong> of the cblocks in the
composite <em>can</em> change every time it is triggered.
</p>

<p>
The lines between the ports on cblocks and iblocks in the Figure above
represent <strong>data relationships</strong> that allow
<strong>to reason</strong> about the semantic conformance (of the models)
of both connected blocks; so, these connections are static
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, and should <em>not</em> be interpreted as
&ldquo;communications&rdquo; of any sort.
The lines from one output trigger to (possibly) multiple input triggers
represents a &ldquo;bus&rdquo;; despite the used terminology, this
bus provides no communication, neither does it encode conformance
constraints between the triggering sblock and the cblock it is triggering. 
The meta model UID and configuration ports have not been connected by
lines in the Figure, since their values can be read and written, in
principle, by any other block, which would overload the graphical
representation; of course, this reading and writing <em>does</em> require
semantic checks at both &ldquo;ends&rdquo; of the (not drawn) connections.
</p>

<p>
From the Figure above, it is apparent that iblocks and sblocks are,
structurally speaking, <em>hyperedges</em> that connect two or more
cblocks. And since each iblock, sblock or cblock can be a composite
microblock in itself, the overall <strong>structural model</strong>
of a <strong>composite microblock</strong> is that of a
<strong>hierarchical hypergraph</strong> (see Figure below).

</table>

<p>
The Figure above shows the <strong>duality</strong> between the sblock
hyperedge and the iblock hyperedge: the former links trigger ports on
multiple cblocks (at various levels of composition!), the latter links data
ports on multiple cblocks. The cblocks are the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_point">invariant points</a>
of the duality transformation: they can connect to all microblock types.
Such dualities are not too useful for <em>users</em> of the models, but
they help <em>developers</em> to reduce the complexity of the meta
modelling, hence also of the software tooling with which they can assist
their users: dualities reduce the number of rules in the meta model
to roughly half, and hence also the amount of code to be written in
the software tooling.
</p>

<p>
Note that the Figure above has two scheduler blocks, and both can trigger some of
the same cblocks. Whether or not this is a valid composition is not part of
the <em>structural</em> part of the meta model, but of the
<strong>(application-specific) policies</strong> (that is, the
relationships and constraints between meta model primitives) that (have to
be) added by each particular application to the <em>structural</em> and
<em>behavioural</em> parts of the meta model. 
</p>

<h3><a name="composition">Composition</a></h3>
<p>
The composite microblock example implies the need for a fourth type of
microblock (in addition to cblock, iblock and sblock), namely a
<strong>Composer (block)</strong>. The Composer is 
<strong>non-functional</strong> since it does not add any
<em>computation behaviour</em> to the composition, and it has no data or
trigger ports to connect to the other functional microblocks. But a
Composer block does have meta data UID ports, and one or more iblocks to
store the &ldquo;composition data&rdquo;. Indeed, inside its composite
block, a Composer microblock serves as the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_registry">meta data registry</a>
for all microblocks and their interconnections. This data can be stored in
an iblock, but a Composer should also have its own cblocks and sblocks when
it is responsible for the runtime creation of the
<em>interconnection structure</em> of the
&ldquo;functional&rdquo; cblocks, iblocks and sblocks. It also needs
computational behaviour (hence cblocks, iblocks and sblocks, in general) to
check the semantic conformance of the interconnected ports. That
registry information can be used by a runtime
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker_Pattern">microblocks broker</a>,
helping tools, visualisers, loggers, and other systems to all
the information they need to interact with the current microblocks system.
</p>


<h3><a name="deployment">Activation &mdash; Deployment</a></h3>
<p>
A microblocks system is not executing by itself, but must be activated
(&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment">deployed</a>&rdquo;)
on an execution platform (operating system, runtime,&hellip;), possibly
with several others at the same time. The information in their (meta) models can be used by a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_%28object-oriented_programming%29">factory</a>
activity in the deployed system, responsible for loading all the necessary
code into the (operating) system's memory. Note that the <em>composer</em>
itself is <em>not</em> a factory, since, as a microblock <em>model</em>, it
should <em>have no side-effects</em>. Such side effects are definitely
there during a deployment activity, since that has to connect to the
operating system, or call CPU and memory operations on &ldquo;bare&rdquo;
hardware.
</p>



<h3><a name="metamodel">Formal meta model</a></h3>
<p>
The previous paragraphs introduced all concepts in the meta model in a
human-readable way; now it's time to turns these descriptions into formal
representations. The <strong>structural part</strong> of the microblocks'
<em>formal meta model</em> can be created as an <em>extension</em> to the
<em>hierarchical hypergraph</em> (&ldquo;<em>HH</em>&rdquo;) meta model
(currently in beta):
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>
the HH <strong>node primitive</strong> gets 
realisations for cblocks, iblocks, sblocks and Composer blocks, and for
ports (data, configuration, meta data UIDs, and triggers).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
the HH <strong>edge primitive</strong>
(&ldquo;<strong><code>connects</code></strong>&rdquo; relationship) gets
six realisations :
cblock&ndash;port,
cblock&ndash;trigger,
iblock&ndash;port,
sblock&ndash;trigger,
port&ndash;port, and
trigger&ndash;trigger.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
the HH <strong><code>contains</code> relationship</strong> is used to represent
<strong>hierarchical composition</strong>. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
the <strong>policy</strong> is introduced that ports can connect
microblocks <em>through</em> these hierarchical composition boundaries.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
each application domain introduces <strong>extra constraint policies</strong>
on which <code>connnects</code> and <code>contains</code> compositions make
sense in that domain.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The <strong>behavioural part</strong> has the following
<strong>primitives</strong> and <strong>relationships</strong>:
<strong>port data models</strong> connected to Ports,
<strong>function models</strong> connected to cblocks,
<strong>port data relationships</strong> connected to iblocks, and
<strong>schedule sequence relationships</strong> connected to sblocks.
All these are to be defined by the application domains.
</p>


<h3>Implementations</h3>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/kmarkus/microblx">microblx</a></strong>:
Markus Klotzb&uuml;cher's project is currently the only (almost) full
reference implementation of the <em>microblocks</em> meta model, using C
and Lua. The development can be followed (and improved) via its
<a href="http://lists.mech.kuleuven.be/mailman/admindb/microblx">mailing list</a>.
<br/>
<code>microblx</code> provides the core mechanism, and also already some
<em>bridges</em> like a lock-free buffer, or a web interface that can
display the structural mode of a microblocks system, change the
configurations of microblocks, trigger them, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://orocos.org/rtt">Orocos/RTT</a></strong>: this
framework contains most of the necessary <em>mechanism</em> (blocks
(&ldquo;TaskContext&rdquo;) ports, triggers
(&ldquo;<code>updateHook()</code>&rdquo;, and pseudo-semantic data models),
but provides also a lot of <em>policies</em> that serve RTT's main target:
OS-level containers for hard realtime <em>activities</em>.
<br/>
The <a href="http://rock-robotics.org">ROCK</a> toolkit adds a
microblocks-conforming <em>composer</em> functionality, as well as the
possibility to introduce <em>hierarchy</em> in the composition.
</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.ros.org">ROS</a></strong> conforms to
microblocks only to a very low extent: microblocks and ports, with a
pseudo-semantic data model. It lacks all support for efficient scheduling,
and for hierarchical composition.
<p>
All implementations should conform to the model explained above, but they
can vary in the policies they offer. For example, one implementation might
only support <em>lists</em> inside scheduler cblocks, while another one might
<em>compute</em> the schedule from a set of rules and the current state of
the system.
</p>


<h3><a name="bridges">Bridges and Proxies</a></h3>
<p>
The <strong>integration</strong> between a sub-system conforming to the
microblocks model, and other sub-systems that don't, requires the
introduction of &ldquo;bridges&rdquo;. (Or rather, this <em>is</em> the
definition of a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo;.) Again, this document focuses on (the
model of) the
<em>mechanism</em>, and not on concrete behavioural policies. Hence, the
presented (models of) &ldquo;bridge architectures&rdquo; are expected to be
independent of the particular choices in communication middleware,
networking hardware, operating system services, etc.

<p>
The inevitable trend in modern (robotics and other)
<em>cyber-physical systems</em> is towards
(i) <strong>high heterogeneity</strong> of sub-systems and sub-system
providers, and (ii) <strong>high flexibility</strong> in how to connect the
sub-systems together to realise the desired system-level behaviour. Hence,
bridging between sub-systems is not just a matter of
<em>communication of data</em> anymore, but also of (i) semantic checking
and transformation, and even of
(ii) <strong>context-aware adaptation</strong> of sub-system
<em>behaviour</em>. The answer within the <em>microblocks</em> design
paradigm is the concept of a <strong>proxy</strong> cblock: a proxy
represents one
sub-system in another one, in order (i) <em>to bridge</em> the communication gap,
but (ii) also <em>to adapt</em> its &ldquo;embedded proxy
<em>behaviour</em>&rdquo; to the host's context. That is, it adapts to the
&ldquo;Quality of Service&rdquo; of the application-level interaction
between host and proxy, and to the &ldquo;Quality of Service&rdquo; of the
data interaction inside the bridges.
</p>
<p>
Roughly speaking, bridges are <em>composite iblocks</em>, while proxies are
<em>remotely represented cblocks</em>.
So, proxies are all about <em>behaviour and policies</em>, but this
section limits itself to the <em>structural</em> aspects of such
<strong>&ldquo;bridge-and-proxy architectures&rdquo;</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The Figure above sketches an example of a (potentially) distributed robotic system
architecture using microblock bridges and proxies. The robot, sensor and
GUI &ldquo;agents&rdquo; are connected to the world model agent, via
bridges, which they use to perform their intended <em>data
interaction</em>. 
</p>
<p>
The medium-term ambition of the <em>microblocks</em> project is to provide
models and reference implementations of various types of bridges to serve
different use cases; proxies will have to be added by application
developers, but later sections of this document already introduce some of
the major categories of robotics application sub-systems that can make use
of proxies (and bridges). First, here is a (non-exhaustive) list of
complementary <em>types of bridges</em>:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>
<strong>data model bridge</strong>: even between two microblock components
that work in the same thread and hence can share memory via iblocks, a
bridge might be needed if one or more of the ports through which they want
to interact have a different data model. For example, one is representing
distance in kilometers, while the other one uses nautical miles.
<em>If</em> both data models are semantically overlapping (as is the case
in this example), the solution is as straigthforward as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_transformation">model-to-model
transformation</a> to be realised in a composite iblock, that is, a bridge.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>programming language bridge</strong>: the problem above is almost
inevitable if two different programming languages are being used, for
example <em>C</em> and <em>C++</em>. One &ldquo;side&rdquo; of such a
bridge should be completely conforming to the <em>microblock</em> model;
else, it should not be called a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo;.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>threading bridge</strong>: when two microblock composites are
activated in two 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29">threads</a>,
traditional 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication">
Inter-Process Communication</a> solutions are required. Both ends of such
an IPC <em>could</em> have a <em>microblocks</em>-conforming interface, and
even the whole bridge can be implemented with microblocks, <em>except</em>
when 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locking_%28computer_science%29">locking</a>
primitives are used because those introduce <em>side effects</em>.
</p>
<p>
Possible designs of this bridge, as well as of the following ones, is documented
in more detail in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object">active object</a>
pattern, as documented in, for example: Lavender, R. Greg; Schmidt, Douglas
C., <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Act-Obj.pdf">Active Object</a>.
Also the <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all">&Oslash;MQ Guide</a>
contains a lot of valuable suggestions.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>process bridge</strong>: both ends are activated in separate
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_%28computing%29">processes</a>
on the same operating system, hence OS-level IPC is required.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>communication bridge</strong>: idem, but now requiring 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">fieldbus middleware</a>
in between.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>semantic bridge</strong>: this is, in general, the most complex
one, because it can contain all of the above, <em>and</em> it also has to translate one
end's semantics in the other end's semantics. Often, this translation
implies a loss of semantics because both ends do not have exactly the same
semantics. Examples of semantic bridges are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 transforming maps in similar but not identical 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a>
standards, such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Maps">Here</a>.
</li>
<li>
memory transformations on transmitted data.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>


<h3><a name="subsystems">Sub-systems &mdash; Closures</a></h3>
<p>
The <a href="#bridges">previous section</a> added <em>policies</em> on top
of the microblocks <em>mechanism</em> to provide template solutions to
commonly occurring <strong>technical interoperability</strong> problems.
The policies introduced in this section provide template solutions to
commonly occurring <strong>sub-systems</strong>. These are just one more
level of composition away from full-fledged <strong>applications</strong>.
The difference between sub-systems and applications is that the extra
composition of an application is used to solve the application-level
optimizations, and <em>only those</em>.
For example, a <em><a href="#motionstack">motion control stack</a></em> is
a sub-system, because the exact behaviour of the controlled
motion should be determined by the application that requires the motion.
Similarly, a Bayesian probability network for 
<em><a href="#perceptionnetwork">sensor fusion</a></em> is a sub-system,
because the exact set of sensors, features, object properties and task
requirements should be determined by the application that requires the
perception data.

(i.c., the bridges and the world model) do not have ports (which provide a
<strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29">closure</a>&rdquo;
for data and computations</strong>) but they do have a semantic meaning,
namely the <strong>closure for knowledge</strong>: the context-specific
information based on which the data and computations are configured. Unlike
port-closures, <em>knowledge-closures can overlap</em>; they are typically
also not visible in the runtime functional code, but only show up in the
offline tooling and the runtime reasoning about how to compose and
(re)configure a particular system.
</p>

<p>
The subsections below each discuss one common
&ldquo;template application&rdquo; of port-based systems, and show the
mapping from their traditional &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; to their microblocks
equivalent. Of course, the mapping is not <em>one-to-one</em> (hence not
<em>reversible</em>), since the microblocks version allows a <em>richer
semantics</em> with respect to data and triggering.

<h4><a name="controldiagrams">Control and data flow diagrams</a></h4>
<p>
Many algorithms in robotics are described, taught and implemented as data
flow diagrams, with or without feedback. In the latter case, the data flow
diagram is often also used a data pipeline or
<a href="">DAG</a>.

<p>
Modelling data flows with the microblocks meta model is rather
straigthforward. Most application domains, however, do not add the
<em>iblocks</em> as explicitly shared memory, and the <em>sblocks</em>
as explicitly represented execution serialization.
</p>


<h4><a name="motionstack">Motion control stack</a></h4>
<p>
One of the major traditional applications of control diagrams is the
so-called &ldquo;motion control stack&rdquo; of a robotic (or machine tool)
system. It is a combination of hierarchically nested levels of control,
where a deeper level deals with a physical phenomenom with a higher natural
time constant. Again, the mainstream descriptions and implementations of
motion control stacks make a lot of &ldquo;hidden assumptions&rdquo; about
the execution serialization, and hide most of the &ldquo;computational
state&rdquo; of the control stack.
